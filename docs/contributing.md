# Contributing

We are currently using GitHub Pages, Markdown formats and the mkdocs system with the Material theme.  To contribute lesson plans
you can fork this GitHub repository and then clone the forked repository to your local system.  You can use the mkdocs serve function to view your
documentation locally and test the links.  When you are satisfied with your work you can commit your code to your personal forked repository and then submit a pull request.

If you would like to request a new lesson plan or exercie you can use the issues section of this repository.  You can label your issue as a New Feature of the system.

If you have questions, please contact Dan McCreary (Dan.McCreary@gmail.com).

Thanks!
